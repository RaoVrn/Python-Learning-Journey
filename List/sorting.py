# The goal of this script is to sort the elements of a list in alphabetical order

# Define a list of characters
list = ["C", "D", "A", "A", "B", "B", "A"]

# Use the built-in sort method to sort the list in-place (i.e., modify the original list)
list.sort()

# Print the sorted list
print(list)
